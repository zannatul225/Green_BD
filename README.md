# Green_BD

Project “GreenBD” focuses on automated waste management by collecting the waste materials from different sectors. The automated process includes:
 1. Collecting household trashes from apartments using smart dustbin with elevator system, 
2. Real time tracking the trash cans 
3. Collecting truck having automated hand
4. Recognition of trashes via image processing and automated sensors
5. Recycling of degradable waste (e.g. paper waste)
6. Renewable energy production using biogas plant
7. Neutralization of chemical waste using chemical furnace
8. Neutralization of plastics and polythene following an automated process
9. Management and monitoring of this whole process will be accessed online. 
 

How are you solving?
There are mainly 3 types of garbage: degradable, organic waste, plastic. The main target of our procedure is to recycle the trash and reuse them in every efficient way as possible.  
Collecting household trashes: There will be 3 different section in each smartbin for the different waste type. Once it is full, the smartbin will deposit the trash to the main smartbox. Then trash collecting trucks will collect the trash of every houses. The trucks will have their predefined locations. The trucks will then bring the trash to the dumping zone i.e. the waste management area. If the smartbin is almost full, it will send a distress signal to collect the trash immediately. 
After getting them in the trash managing area, all the trash will be examined to ensure its type.  Through the process of image recognition and using sensors trashes will be sorted into 3 different containers for the processing part. Organic wastes will be processed to make fertilizers and to build Bio-gas plants. Plastic will be processed in two parts; one will be based on recycling the plastic and another will be to incinerate. The smoke from the incineration process will be purified.
Collecting Industrial waste: We have found that industrial wastes have different type of wastes like degradable waste, chemicals, hazardous waste, toxic waste, ignitable waste, corrosive or reactive. All these wastes will be collected separately. Trash collecting truck will collect these trashes every day and bring them to the waste management area. Toxic waste will be neutralized or kept from reaching water sources. Chemical and hazardous waste will be neutralized in a treatment plant. Ignitable waste will be used as a fuel for relevant works.


Hospital waste: 
Different types of waste materials come from hospital. Such as:
•	Medical Waste
•	Biomedical Waste
•	Clinical Waste
•	Biohazardous Waste
•	Regulated Medical Waste (RMW)
•	Infectious Medical Waste
•	Healthcare waste
These trashes will be collected separately and then gathered to the trash management zone for further proceedings.
School, Colleges and University waste:
In school, colleges there produced huge amount of instructional materials, used electronics, and food. One estimate is that 24% of school waste is recyclable paper and 50% is food waste and non-recyclable paper that can be composted. 
After collecting Chemical and degradable waste from schools and colleges and hospitals. They will be processed in the same way it was processed explained previously.
Infectious waste from hospitals will be incinerated so that it won’t be able to harm anyone.

What are the technologies are you using?
We are using automation systems for our project. This system includes both software and hardware. The collection cans of every houses will have elevator system to drop the trashes in the large trash box of the building. Then each day the trash collecting truck will go to collect these trashes using locator from our software. With the robotic hand to carry the trash box and dump them into the truck. Then for further proceedings these will be carried to the waste management area.
After assembling them in the waste processing area they will go through an automated monitoring process. Here the trashes will be checked that which category they belong to. We will be using image processing for visual recognition and some sensors to physically detect which category waste they belong to. 
The degradable waste will go through the process of recycling if they are capable of recycling. Otherwise they will be sent to the renewable energy producing sector.
The non-degradable waste will go through the process of recycling or be melted down with a special procedure. 
Chemical wastes will be managed via neutralization. 
This is how using technology we will be solving this very problem.
